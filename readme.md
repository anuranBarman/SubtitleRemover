## Subtitle Remover

Downloaded Udemy Course from somewhere and have got subtitles here and there within the course video folder
that it's being hard to get the video file instantly?

Just run this python script to remove all the subtitle files **(.srt)** from all over the course folder.

## Usage

```
python3 remover.py <YOUR COURSE ROOT FOLDER>
```
